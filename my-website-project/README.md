## Usage

- The `src/index.ts` file serves as the entry point for the application, initializing the app and linking the HTML and CSS.
- The `src/components/header.ts` file contains the `Header` class, which manages the header section of the website.
- Styles are defined in `src/styles/main.css`, which controls the visual aspects of the application.
- Type definitions are located in `src/types/index.ts`, ensuring type safety throughout the project.
- Utility functions can be found in `src/utils/helpers.ts`, providing common functionalities.
